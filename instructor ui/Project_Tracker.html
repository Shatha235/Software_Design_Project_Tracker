        Project Tracker is a system that allows the instructor to track the work of a
        group of students on a specific project. At the same time students can use the system
        to manage their work and with the instructor. Suppose we have a class with enough
        number of students to be divided into two groups or more, Therefore, the instructor
        has the ability to assign each student to a specific team and give each member a
        specific role. Moreover, the instructor can create a project with required
        specifications and properties such as tasks, time, deliverables, etc. Students in the
        same team can communicate together by broadcasting a message that appears on all
        team members' side. They can also communicate with the instructor.
        At any time, students can set the status of a task as to start later on, working
        on, finished on time, finished with delay, etc. and the instructor can review the task
        and give feedback for students on the task.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task has a title, description, progress estimation, start date, end due date, actual
        end date, or any other suggested properties. The task can be assigned to one or
        more of the students. Group members or the instructor can put a comment on the
        task and others can reply to it.
